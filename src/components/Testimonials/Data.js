Asfand is an extremely generous and communicative host. The place, without a doubt, was exactly as described: spacious, comfy, warm, welcoming, clean and located centrally to everywhere one could possibly want to go. If I'm ever back in Isb I know exactly where it is I'm staying. Many thanks to Asfand and his helper who made my weekend stay a memorable and truly unforgettable experience!",
